      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>Effective Date: 24 August 2025</p>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of
        DeadTime (“we,” “our,” or “us”), including our mobile application,
        website, and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By using the
        Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the
        Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your
        jurisdiction to create an account. You agree to provide accurate,
        complete, and current information and to keep it updated. You are
        responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Content</h2>
      <p>
        You retain all rights to the messages and content you record or upload
        ("User Content"). By uploading User Content, you grant us a limited
        license to store, encrypt, and deliver the content to your designated
        recipients in accordance with your settings. You represent that you have
        all necessary rights to provide the User Content and that it does not
        infringe or violate the rights of any third party.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use the Service for any illegal purpose or to transmit unlawful,
          defamatory, harassing, or fraudulent content;
        </li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers;</li>
        <li>
          Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or other user
          accounts;
        </li>
        <li>
          Upload malware or any other harmful code or attempt to reverse
          engineer our software;
        </li>
        <li>
          Use any automated means to access the Service (such as scraping bots or
          spiders) without our prior written consent.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Certain features require a paid subscription. By subscribing, you agree
        to pay the applicable fees and authorize us to charge your payment
        method on a recurring basis. Subscription fees are non-refundable except
        as required by law. You may cancel your subscription at any time; your
        cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time if we
        believe you have violated these Terms or if necessary to protect our
        users. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease
        immediately, but sections intended to survive termination will remain in
        effect.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We make no
        warranties regarding the Service, including but not limited to
        warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
        non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Service will be
        uninterrupted or error-free.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, DeadTime will not be liable for
        any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or
        any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or
        indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible
        losses, resulting from (a) your use or inability to use the Service;
        (b) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers; or (c) any conduct
        of any third party on the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without
        regard to its conflict of law principles. You agree to submit to the
        exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San
        Diego County, California for any dispute arising out of these Terms or
        your use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may revise these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of
        material changes by posting the updated Terms on our website or sending
        an email to the address associated with your account. Your continued use
        of the Service after the changes become effective constitutes your
        acceptance of the new Terms.
