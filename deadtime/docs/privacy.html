      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective Date: 24 August 2025</p>
      <p>
        DeadTime (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides a platform for recording,
        scheduling, and delivering messages to loved ones. We take your
        privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal data. This
        Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it,
        and how we use, store and protect it.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following categories of data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we
          collect your email address and a password (stored as a hash). We do not
          collect unnecessary information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Message Content:</strong> You may upload video, audio or text
          messages. These are encrypted and stored securely in our cloud storage
          provider until delivered.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recipient Details:</strong> Names and email addresses (or phone
          numbers) of your recipients so that we can deliver your messages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect basic analytics (e.g. last
          login date) to determine inactivity and operate the service. We do not
          track your activity for marketing purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Legal Basis and Consent</h2>
      <p>
        We only process your personal data when we have a lawful basis to do so.
        Our primary legal bases are contractual necessity (to provide the
        service), legitimate interests (to ensure security and functionality),
        and your explicit consent. In accordance with data protection laws such
        as the GDPR, consent must be freely given, specific, informed and
        unambiguous【32231640842400†L104-L114】. You may withdraw your consent at any
        time by deleting your account or contacting us. When you withdraw
        consent, we stop collecting and processing your data【32231640842400†L104-L114】.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Data Minimization</h2>
      <p>
        We follow the principle of data minimization by collecting only the
        minimum amount of information necessary to provide our service【937969418581650†L123-L129】. We
        do not request sensitive personal data such as race, gender, or health
        information. If you choose to include such information in your messages,
        you acknowledge that you are voluntarily providing it.
      </p>

      <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use your information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain and improve the DeadTime service;</li>
        <li>Store and schedule your messages for future delivery;</li>
        <li>
          Authenticate your account and send confirmation emails (e.g. to notify
          you of impending inactivity triggers);
        </li>
        <li>
          Comply with our legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service;
        </li>
        <li>
          Respond to your inquiries and provide customer support.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Storage, Encryption & Backup</h2>
      <p>
        Your messages are stored in encrypted form in our cloud storage
        provider. Sensitive files are encrypted before being saved and we use
        industry-standard encryption protocols (AES-256) to protect data in
        transit and at rest. We follow the 3‑2‑1 backup rule — three copies of
        important files, on two different types of media, with one stored off‑site【35789964984834†L262-L269】. We
        also encourage you to test your backups regularly【35789964984834†L262-L269】.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We use third‑party service providers for hosting (e.g., AWS), email
        delivery and payment processing. These providers may process your data
        only to the extent necessary to perform their services and are bound by
        strict confidentiality and security obligations. We do not sell or rent
        your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        If you access our services from outside the United States, please be
        aware that your data may be transferred to, stored and processed in the
        United States. We implement safeguards to ensure an adequate level of
        protection for personal data transferred internationally.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the personal data we hold about you;</li>
        <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
        <li>
          Object to or restrict the processing of your data where legally
          permitted;
        </li>
        <li>
          Withdraw consent for data processing (note that this may affect your
          ability to use the service);
        </li>
        <li>
          Lodge a complaint with a data protection authority in your jurisdiction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active and
        for a reasonable period thereafter to comply with legal obligations and
        resolve disputes. Messages scheduled for delivery are retained until
        delivered or deleted by you.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        DeadTime is not designed for children under 13. We do not knowingly
        collect personal information from children. If we discover that a child
        under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any material changes via email or through a notice on our website. The
        updated policy will be effective when posted.
      </p>
